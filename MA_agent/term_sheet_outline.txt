Template term sheet - M&A transaction 
This is a template term sheet for use when one tech company is acquiring the shares of another tech company.  It sets out the principal terms agreed between the acquiring company and the shareholders of the target company prior to preparing the formal sale and purchase agreement.  The acquisition of a competing and/or complementary business in this manner is a common strategy of well-funded high growth technology companies.
This term sheet assumes that the transaction will be structured as a share sale (as is most common).  It should not be used in connection with the acquisition of the business and assets of a target company.  This term sheet is not legally binding (other than the confidentiality obligations in part B); it simply sets out the terms agreed in relation to the acquisition.  
applicable law
This document is intended for use by companies domiciled in Southeast Asia.  Because the laws in each Southeast Asian country are different, you should have the document reviewed by a local lawyer.  We have suggested (as a placeholder) that the document be subject to Singapore law as this is the most common domicile of post-funded tech companies in Southeast Asia, and Singapore is well respected as a legal jurisdiction.
